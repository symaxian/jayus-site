<h2>Frame</h2>
<p>
	The frame of an entity is the rectangular region that the entity's bounds are contained in. In most cases the bounding region for an entity will be its frame. Though an entity's bounding region is treated as its "physical region" and is used to test for intersection, each entity is still often treated as being like a rectangle. This is apparent in the presence of the getter and setter functions for the sides of each entity.

	<h4>Base Frame</h4>
	<p>
		An entity's base frame does not include scaling.

<h2>Bounds</h2>
<p>
	The "physical" region of the entity, used for distance and collision checking. The frame of an entity is the rectangular region that the entity's bounds are contained in. In most cases the bounding region for an entity will be its frame.

	In The image above, the bounds for the blue circle are shown in red, which is itself another circle, identical in position and size to the original blue one.

<h2>Position & Anchor</h2>
<p>
	Each entity has a position, this is the location of its anchor point relative to its parent's position. A entity's anchor point is defined in terms of the width of its frame as x and y alignments. So that an anchor point of (0,0) would refer to the top-left corner of the entity and an anchor point of (1,1) would refer to the bottom-right corner. Any anchor alignment values may be given, even those outside of the entity's frame. In scaling and rotating an entity, the anchor point is used as the location to scale the entity from, and the point to rotate around.
</p>

<h2>Absolute Position</h2>
<p>
	Each entity is positioned relative to its parent, so its position is said to be within its parent's coordinate space. Comparing the positions of entities across coordinate spaces does not often give the desired result, for two object's positions to be compared they should be within the same coordinate space. The easiest way to compare the positions of two entities in the same coordinate space is to use their absolute position, that is their position from the display.
</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>
	The scope of an entity is the rectangular region that fully encompasses the pixels that would modified by rendering the entity. The scope of an entity may be larger or smaller than it's frame that it's frame. The scope of an entity has no "physical" purpose but is used in rendering optimizations. The smaller the scope of an entity, the less rendering needs to take place. The scope is often referred to as the dirtied rectangle, as when the object is drawn onto an image, the area of the image that was modified by rendering the object has been dirtied.

	In The image above, the scope of the blue circle is shown in red, it is larger than the frame due to the thick blue stroke and the large green shadow styling on the circle.
