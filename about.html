<h2>Jayus</h2>
<p>
	Jayus started a while ago, out of the need to build a feature-rich API on top of the very simplistic 2d canvas drawing interface. What started out as a few global objects housing some rudimentary routines eventually grew over time into a full-fledged scenegraph. It is not time-tested, nor close to being finished, or as elegant or orthogonal as I would like, but for the most part it is well designed and built on quite a few powerful concepts, and may grow into something very deserving of recognition.

<h2>The Tools</h2>

<!-- <h4>JSFiddle</h4>
<p>
	JSFiddle is a great in-browser sandbox for web pages, allowing HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more to be edited and updated instantly right in a browser. Due to it's flexibility and ease of use I've used it extensively to test and showcase Jayus.

<h4>jGrouseDoc</h4>
<p>
	The API documentation is automatically generated from block comments in the source code, courtesy of jGrouseDoc. Though seemingly forgotten, it is an excellent documentation generator that I highly recommend.

<h4>Closure Compiler</h4>
<p>
	Despite it's very misleading name(come on Google, really?), the closure compiler does not compile closures(which is a name for another programming concept). It minimizes JavaScript source code, compressing and trimming multiple source files into one. As Jayus is a large project consisting of many source files, the Closure Compiler is used to minimize these to reduce the filesize and increase performance. For more info see the <a href="articles/compilation.html">compilation article</a>.

<h4>Bootstrap</h4>
<p>
	Bootstrap(from Twitter) was used to create this site.
	<br>
	Update: as of posting this site, Twitter Bootstrap seems to have evolved far beyond what it originally was, so it is an older copy of the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files that are used in this site.
